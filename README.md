# OPEN-SOURCE-TECHNOLOGY-MINI-PROJECT
LAMP is an open-source Web development platform that uses Linux as the operating system, Apache as the Web server, MySQL as the relational database management system and PHP/Perl/Python as the object-oriented scripting language.

Sometimes LAMP is referred to as a LAMP stack because the platform has four layers. Stacks can be built on different operating systems.

LAMP is a example of a web service stack, named as an acronym. The LAMP components are largely interchangeable and not limited to the original selection. LAMP is suitable for building dynamic web sites and web applications.

Since its creation, the LAMP model has been adapted to another component, though typically consisting of free and open-source software.
